# Imdb-Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

This is my school project for my Machine Learning class at the University of Information Technology (DS103.N21).

## Getting Started

Sentiment analysis of imdb comments with kaggle dataset (https://shorturl.at/aiqxS) is the topic of this research.
In this assignment, I will try a variety of approaches. I will then compare those techniques and select the best one to use.
### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the repository.

* Python
* Imported libraries
* The dataset (https://shorturl.at/aiqxS)

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ You can get the dataset here: https://shorturl.at/aiqxS
$ Set up Python and the Jupiter notebook.
$ Install the libraries that I imported.
```

## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.

```
$ Import dataset and library in the folder like the order of the repository.
$ Execute the.ipynb files (modify the dataset folder as necessary)
$ Examine the results.
$ We will extend these features later for future implementation (input new comments and auto sentiment identify them).
```

## Deployment

Further information on how to deploy this on a live or release system. Describes the most significant branches, the pipelines they activate, and how to update the database (if anything special).
